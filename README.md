# 📊 Bank Loan Report Dashboard

This project is a **Bank Loan Report Dashboard** built using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for data analysis and **Excel** for dashboard visualization.  
The goal of this project is to analyze loan data, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the banking sector.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The bank needed a reporting solution to:

- Monitor lending activities and portfolio health
- Distinguish between Good Loans and Bad Loans
- Track Total Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Interest Rates, and DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio)
- Provide insights on loan purposes, terms, borrower profiles, and regional trends

**Full problem statement:** See `Problem Statement - Bank Loan Report Analysis Project.docx`

## 🚀 Result / Outcome

- Built **3 interactive dashboards** (Summary, Overview, Details) that provide a 360° view of the bank’s loan portfolio.
- Delivered **5+ key insights** to help stakeholders in decision-making, such as:
  - Portfolio strength with **86% Good Loans**
  - Identification of **Debt Consolidation** as the top loan purpose
  - Borrower employment stability insights (**10+ years segment dominating**)
  - Regional concentration of loan applications
  - Borrower preference for **36-month loan terms**
- Enabled the bank to track **KPIs in real-time** (Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Interest Rates, DTI) and differentiate between Good vs Bad loans.
- Provided a **data-driven foundation** for strategic planning, risk management, and targeted marketing.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### Data Analysis (SQL Server Management Studio)
- Cleaned and explored raw loan data
- Wrote SQL queries to extract KPIs (applications, funded amounts, repayment trends, interest rates, DTI, etc.)
- Documented query results for dashboard preparation

### Dashboard Building (Excel)
- Created **3 dashboards**:
  - **Summary Dashboard** → Loan KPIs, Good vs Bad Loans
  - **Overview Dashboard** → Monthly trends, State-wise distribution, Term, Purpose, Employee Length, Home Ownership
  - **Details Dashboard** → Grid view of loan metrics for deeper analysis
